# Hello-world
Hello there, this is my second attempt creating a repository but my long term goal is to share my source code with the community.

Hi my name is Trisha and my goal in life at the moment is to find the king of rock and roll the love of my life. I also would like to be a part of the community.

ive just created a repository "Hello world" with a read me file then i created a branch (i forgotten already) so i had a master branch and a read me then i made a commit by creating this message.
